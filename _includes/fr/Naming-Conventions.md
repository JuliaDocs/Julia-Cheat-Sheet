The main convention in Julia is to avoid underscores unless they are required for legibility.

Variable names are in lower (or snake) case: `somevariable`.

Constants are in upper case: `SOMECONSTANT`.

Functions are in lower (or snake) case: `somefunction`.

Macros are in lower (or snake) case: `@somemacro`.

Type names are in initial-capital camel case: `SomeType`.

Julia files have the `jl` extension.
