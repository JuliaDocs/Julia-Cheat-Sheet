[Julia](https://julialang.org) is an open-source, multi-platform,
high-level, high-performance programming language for technical
computing.

Julia has an

<a class="tooltip" href="#">JIT<span> Just-In-Time compilation occurs at
run-time rather than prior to execution, which means it offers both the

compiler that allows it to match the performance of languages such as C
and FORTRAN without the hassle of low-level code. Because the code is
compiled on the fly you can run (bits of) code in a shell or

Julia is dynamically typed, provides

parallelism and distributed computation.

Julia has a built-in package manager.

Julia has many built-in mathematical functions, including special
functions (e.g. Gamma), and supports complex numbers right out of the
box.

Julia allows you to generate code automagically thanks to Lisp-inspired
macros.

Julia was born in 2012.
