Workers are also known as concurrent/parallel processes.

Modules with parallel processing capabilities are best split into a
functions file that contains all the functions and variables needed by
all workers, and a driver file that handles the processing of data. The
driver file obviously has to import the functions file.

A non-trivial (word count) example of a reducer function is provided by
[Adam DeConinck](https://blog.ajdecon.org/parallel-word-count-with-julia-an-interesting).
